Classes in Python are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods), promoting code reuse, modularity, and organization.
In object-oriented programming (OOP), classes enable:
-> Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods together.
-> Inheritance – Allowing new classes to derive properties from existing ones.
-> Polymorphism – Enabling different classes to be used interchangeably.
Classes help structure large programs efficiently, making code more maintainable, scalable, and reusable.
